    <Ol><H3>The procedure</H3>
        In order to 
        <li>Prepare the onions and garlic by dicing them roughly.</li>
        <li>Seperate half of the onions and garlic. half will be used for the sauce, the other half will be used in the beef</li>
        <li>Saute the garlic and onions in a large pot with olive oil until they soften and are fragrant</li>
        <li>Add the canned tomatoes to the pot and bring this to a low simmer and season to taste</li>
        <li>Simmer the tomato sauce for at least an hour </li>
        <li>In a high walled pan, saute the onions and garlic and then brown the minced beef</li>
        <li>Once the ground beef has been cooked through, add it to the sauce mixture</li>
        <li>Clean the high walled pan, we will use this to make the Bechemel sauce</li>
        <li>Heat 2tbsp of butter in the pan, after the butter has browned mix 2 tbsp of flour in the pan to form a roux</li>
        <li>Cook the roux until it is a dark blond and then add 2 cups of cold milk to the pan slowly and mix it well until it thickens</li>
        <li>You now have a basic Bechemel sauce. you can add 1/2 a cup of the ricotta and mozzarella cheeses. add salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Cook the Lasagna noodles per their package instructions and set them aside until they are cooled enough to handle</li>
        <Li>Once the pasta has cooled a bit and the suace is done, Its time to layer the lasagna.</Li>
        <Li>At the bottom of a baking pan or casserole dish lay down a thin layer of the tomato sauce</Li>
        <li>On top of the first tomato sauce layer,then pasta,then the riccotta cheese, then the tomato sauce, then the Bechemel sauce, then we loop back to the pasta</li>
        <li>The last pasta layer should be topped with the tomato sauce then topped with shredded mozzarella or the freshly grated Parmesan</li>
        <li>After the beast has been assembled, bake at 375F for 30 minutes</li>
